# Kei-pyHTML-Editor
Full-Features Stand-Alone Python HTML Editor

Requires pywebview and all its dependencies. https://pywebview.flowrl.com/

Small, but remarkably powerful, this stand-alone word processor was designed to be dropped into projects with a minimum of effort.

Lots of good folks have written simple editors that take advantage of the JavaScript execCommand to compose and format HTML documents. This project goes well beyond the capabilities of these other tools by using specialized JavaScript functions to create richly styled CSS documents with Tables, Lists and lots of other elements. Spell Checking and Find and Replace are also implemented.

And undo/redo works with everything.

Improvements to the code base are welcome and encouraged.
